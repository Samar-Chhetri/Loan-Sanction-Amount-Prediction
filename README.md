# Loan Sanction Amount Prediction (Classification + Regression)

This a personal project I did for learning and understanding how to build machine learning models in a step by step processs. I am a beginner in ML and still learning. So if there are any mistakes it will be very helpful if you point it out.

#### Any type of questions, suggesstions is gladly accespted

## Theme of the project
A bank goes to a long and traditional processes while providing loan to customers. They normally verify and review the applications manually. After that only, they make decision whether to provide loan or not. First of all, they either approve or disapprove the loan application. If they approve, then they make the decision on how much loan to provide. Normally, 100% loan is not approved. On the basis of details they receive, they pass the loan amount.

In this project, we first of all work on the decision of loan approval. If Yes, then, how much to approve. We have automated the whole processes. Now, bank can easily go through loan sanction process.

Here, we have used both Classification and Regression methods. Classification for loan sanction decision and regression for loan amount sanction decision
